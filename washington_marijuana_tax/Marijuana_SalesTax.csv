2 Represents the quarter sales occurred.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 Starting July 1, 2016 collective gardens (dispensaries) had to close down. Prior to July 1, 2016 we considered all their cannabis sales to be for medical purposes, since all sales were to patients that had approval (or a prescription) from a doctor. Since medical cannabis was subject to sales tax we assumed that most of their taxable retail sales were for cannabis. Unfortunately, if a business was conducting other retail transactions, such as selling t-shirts or paraphernalia, we were not able to distinguish what sales were for cannabis and what sales were for other retail transactions. Some businesses likely had significant other non-medical cannabis retail transactions if they were using their business registration number for other business purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 Retail values were estimated from Department of Revenue (DOR) excise tax returns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5 Data on exempt sales were from DOR excise tax returns. Exempt sales include transactions by cannabis retailers with a medical cannabis endorsement. This includes:
- Sales and donations of cannabis products determined by the Department of Health (DOH) to be beneficial for medical use to qualifying patients and designated providers who have been issued recognition cards.
- Sales and donations of low-THC products to qualifying patients and designated providers who have been issued recognition cards.
- Sales of high-CBD compliant cannabis products to all consumers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6 The weighted average local sales tax rate is updated in October of each year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
